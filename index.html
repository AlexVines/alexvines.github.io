							<article id="intro">
								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="/images/de.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>Hello, I'm Alexandr Kotov. I started my career as an aerospace engineer, graduating from Bauman Moscow State Technical University where I spent 6 years studying plasma physics and rocket propulsion systems.</p>

								<p>My transition into tech began when I discovered programming through teaching robotics. Working with Arduino and C++ sparked my interest, but it was Python's elegance and power that truly captivated me. This led me to pivot from aerospace to data engineering.</p>

								<p>I began as a Data Analyst at PIK, Russia's largest real estate company, where I quickly took ownership of critical infrastructure—replacing an entire consulting firm to manage Tableau Server for 1500+ users. In 2022, I joined inDrive in Mexico City as a Data Engineer, where I now specialize in building scalable ETL/ELT pipelines, implementing LLM-powered solutions, and managing self-hosted data infrastructure.</p>

								<p>Today, I'm passionate about solving complex problems through intelligent automation and continuously exploring new technologies in the data engineering space.</p>
								
								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p><strong>Bauman Moscow State Technical University</strong>, Moscow | 2014 - 2020</p>
								<p>Aerospace Engineering</p>
								<p>Specialty: Design of aviation and rocket engines</p>
								<p>Department of plasma power installations</p>
								<p><em>(BMSTU is one of Russia's top technical universities, often referred to as "Russian MIT")</em></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="/images/BMSTU.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<h2>Hobbies</h2>
								<h3>Sports</h3>
								<p>Sport is a big part of my life. One greatest achievement in my life would have to be my success in the sport of cheerleading. I started practicing at the age of seventeen. Cheerleading is a team-based sport that involves stunting, pyramids, baskets, tumbling, acrobatics. It was initially started in the USA, and now its growing sport in Europe. Why? Because it's fun!</p>
								
								<p>It's a great sport because it's teamwork, it's all about athletes working together in unison to create something spectacular. What have I achieved during all these years of cheerleading? On a first year our team became a second best student team in Moscow and 4th team in Russia. Then after a few years we evolved and became a Russian Champions twice in 2018 and 2019. After that we had an honor to represent our country at the Europe Championship in Helsinki and St. Petersburg.</p>

								<h3>Travelling</h3>
								<p>When I have decent amount of free time I use it to visit a new place. Preferable way to travel is usually hitchhiking. Cheap, fun and challenging. Plus it's the best way to meet locals and get to know a lot about real local mindset and culture!</p>
								<p>I've visited about 60 countries so far and going to increase this number.</p>
