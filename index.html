								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="/images/main_pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hello, My name is Alexandr Kotov. I've just graduated from the best technical university of Russia. I was studying plasma and space technologies for 6 years. So you can call me a rocket scientist.</p>
								<p>I started to get interested in programming few years ago when I started working as a teacher of robotics. I worked a lot with Arduino which based on C++. Then I started to learn Python, which I immediately fell in love with for its simplicity and clarity.</p>
								<p>I'm freelancing in my free time on UpWork, mostly take some simple projects for web-scrapping. I'm also interested in making some simple gaming bots using OpenCV. Sometimes I do data science projects to get some relevant experience. Some of my project I posted on github and you can find it on my <a href="#Projects">project page.</a></p>
								<h2> Education </h2>
								<p>Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Moscow | 2014 - 2020</p>
								<p>Specialty: Design of aviation and rocket engines</p>
								<p>Department of plasma power installations</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="/images/BMSTU.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h2> Hobbies </h2>
								<h3> Sports </h3>
								<p>Sport is a big part of my life. One greatest achievement in my life would have to be my success in the sport of cheerleading.
									 I started practicing at the age of seventeen.
									 Cheerleading is a team-based sport that involves stunting, pyramids, baskets, tumbling, acrobatics.
									 It was initially started in the USA, and now its growing sport in Europe. Why? Because it’s fun!</p>
								<p>It’s a great sport because it’s teamwork, it’s all about athletes working together in unison to create something spectacular.
									What have I achieved during all these years of cheerleading? On a first year our team became a second best student team in Moscow and 4th team in Russia. Then after a few years we evolved and became a Russian Champions twice in 2018 and 2019. After that we had an honor to represent our country at the Europe Championship in Helsinki and St. Petersburg.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="/images/cheer_2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Travelling</h3>
								<p>When I have decent amount of free time I use it to visit a new place. Preferable way to travel is usually hitchhiking. Cheap, fun and challenging. Plus it's the best way to meet locals and get to know a lot about real local mindset and culture!</p>
								<p>I've visited about 30 countries so far and going to increase this number. You can find more about my travels on my social media <a href="#contact">here.</a></p>

								<h2>Data Science Salary Estimator</h2>
								<li>Created a tool that estimates data science salaries.</li>
								<li>Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium.</li>
								<li>Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.</li>
								<li>Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.</li>
								<p></p>
								<h3>Code and Resources Used:</h3>
								<p>Python Version: 3.7</p>
								<p>Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, selenium</p>
								<p>Scraper Github: <a href=https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium>https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium</a></p>
								<p>Scraper Article: <a href=https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905>https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905</a></p>
								<h3>Web Scraping</h3>
								<p>Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, we got the following:</p>
								<li>Job title</li>
								<li>Salary Estimate</li>
								<li>Job Description</li>
								<li>Company rating</li>
								<li>Company name</li>
								<li>Location</li>
								<li>Company Headquarters</li>
								<li>Company Size</li>
								<li>Company Founded Date</li>
								<li>Type of Ownership</li>
								<li>Industry</li>
								<li>Revenue</li>
								<li>Competitors</li>
								<p></p>
								<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
								<p>After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:</p>
								<li>Parsed numeric data out of salary</li>
								<li>Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages</li>
								<li>Removed rows without salary</li>
								<li>Parsed rating out of company text</li>
								<li>Made a new column for company state</li>
								<li>Added a column for if the job was at the company’s headquarters</li>
								<li>Transformed founded date into age of company</li>
								<li>Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description, such as: Python, R, Excel, AWS, Spark</li>
								<li>Column for simplified job title and Seniority</li>
								<li>Column for description length</li>
								<p></p>
								<h3>EDA</h3>
								<p>I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/prj4.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								
								<h3>Model Building</h3>
								<p>First, I transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables. I also split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.</p>
								<p>I tried three different models and evaluated them using Mean Absolute Error. I chose MAE because it is relatively easy to interpret and outliers aren’t particularly bad in for this type of model.</p>
								<p>I tried three different models:</p>
								<li>Multiple Linear Regression – Baseline for the model</li>
								<li>Lasso Regression – Because of the sparse data from the many categorical variables, I thought a normalized regression like lasso would be effective.</li>
								<li>Random Forest – Again, with the sparsity associated with the data, I thought that this would be a good fit.</li>
								<p></p>
								<h3>Model performance</h3>
								<p>The Random Forest model far outperformed the other approaches on the test and validation sets.</p>
								<li>Random Forest : MAE = 11.22</li>
								<li>Linear Regression: MAE = 18.86</li>
								<li>Ridge Regression: MAE = 19.67</li>

								<h2>Banner placing</h2>
								<p>The task is to find the most suitable locations to place banners for tourist-oriented company. This is an example of clusterization problem.</p>
								<p>Imagine that international cruise agency Carnival Cruise Line decided to advertise itself with banners. To test whether it is useful, they've decided to start with only 20 places. The task is to find 20 such locations for placement.</p>
								<p>The agency has offices all around the world. They want to place the banners near the offices so they could easier negotiate and check the result. And also these places should be popular for tourists.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/offices.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Go and check the code <a href=https://github.com/AlexVines/Banners/blob/master/banners.ipynb>here</a></p>
								<h2>Password generator</h2>
								<p>If you don't want to have the same password for every account you have and don't trust google random generator you can use such app to create your personal database, store it on your hard drive and use it when you need.</p>
								<h3>Instructions</h3>
								<li>First I would recomend you to uncomment the commented part to create a database and then comment it back and start using as you want.</li>
								<li>Pick at least 1 option for symbols you want to be in your password. The more you have the more secure is your password.</li>
								<li>Press create password and write down info that refers to the account you're using this password for (e.g. Facebook) and you could provide a link.</li>
								<li>After pressing "Save" button your password with all info you provided is going to store in your database. Good luck!</li>
								<p></p>

								<h2>Sudoku solver</h2>
								<p>This app can help you to solve any sudoku puzzle (if possible solution exists) using backtracking algorythm. GUI part was made using PyGame library.</p>
								<span class="main"><img style="width:50%;" src="images/sudoku.png" alt="" /></span>
